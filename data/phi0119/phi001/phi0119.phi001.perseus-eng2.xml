   <milestone unit="paragraph"/>CREON, King of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, being at war with the Teleboans or Taphians, under the command of Ptereias, sends an army against them. This is commanded by Amphitryon, who leaves his wife Alcmena pregnant at his departure from <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. During his absence from home, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, assuming his form, and Mercury that of his servant Sosia, present themselves to Alcmena, as though just returned from the expedition against the Taphians. By means of this stratagem, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> is admitted to the embraces of Alcmena. While Mercury is keeping watch at the door of Amphitryon’s house, Sosia, who has just arrived at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> with Amphitryon, makes his appearance for the purpose of announcing to Alcmena his master’s return. Mercury, pretending that he himself is the real Sosia, and that the other is an impostor, drives him away from the door. He goes back to his master, who returns with him to the house, and on meeting Alcmena, she denies his assertion that he has but that moment returned from the expedition, and now presents himself to her for the first time since his return. On this, Amphitryon charges her with infidelity, and goes away to the harbour to find a witness who may persuade Alcmena of the truth of his assertions. When he returns, he is first driven away from the house by Mercury, and is afterwards accused by <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> of attempting to personate Amphitryon, which person <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> asserts himself to be. The dispute is referred to Blepharo, the pilot of Amphitryon, who. after making minute enquiries into the matter, professes himself utterly unable to decide between them. In the Fifth Act, at the moment in which Alcmena is delivered of Hercules and Iphiclus, a violent. peal of thunder is heard, and Amphitryon swoons with the shock. Bromia, the attendant of Alcmena, comes out of the house, and having raised Amphitryon from the ground, on his recovery informs him of the delivery of Alcmena. At this juncture, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> descends in his own character, and reveals the mystery to Amphitryon, who then becomes reconciled with his wife. </l>

<head>THE PROLOGUE.</head> 

<sp> <speaker>MERCURY</speaker> 
<l n="1" rend="align(indent)">As, in purchasing and selling your merchandize<note><q>Merchandize</q>: “<foreign xml:lang="lat">Mercimoniis</foreign>.” Mercury was the God of trading and merchandize, and was said to have received his name from the Latin word “<foreign xml:lang="lat">merx</foreign>.” See the tradesman’s prayer to him in the Fasti of Ovid, <bibl n="Ov. Fast. 5.685">B. v., l. 682</bibl>.</note>, you are desirous to render me propitious to your bargains, and that I should assist you in all things; and as both in foreign countries and at home, you desire me to turn to the best advantage the business and the accounts of you all, </l>
<l n="6">and that with fair and ample profit, without end, I should crown the venture both which you have begun, and which you shall begin; and as you wish me to delight you and all yours with joyous news<note><q>With joyous news</q>: Mercury was the messenger of the Gods, and, therefore, the patron of messengers; and, if we may so say, the God of News.</note>—these tidings will I bring, that I may announce them to you, things which in especial are for your common interest </l>
<l n="11">(for already do you know, indeed, that it has been given and assigned to me by the other Divinities, to preside over news and profit):  as you would wish me to favour and promote these things, that lasting gain may ever be forthcoming for you,</l>
<l n="15">so shall you give silence for this play, and so shall you be fair and upright judges here, all of you. Now, by whose command, and for what reason I am come, I’ll tell you, and at the sane time, myself, I will disclose my name. By the command of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> I am come; my name is Mercury<note><q>My name is Mercury</q>: There seems hardly any reason why he should disclose his name, after having, by an enumeration of his attributes, informed the Audience who he is.</note>.</l>
<l n="20"> My father has sent me hither to you to entreat, although, what should as his commands be enjoined on you, he knew that you would do, inasmuch as he knew full well that you venerate and fear himself, as is befitting <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>.</l>
<l n="24">But, certainly, he bade me ask this of you with entreaty, in gentle tones, and in bland accents. For, in fact, this <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, by whose command I am come, dreads a mishap<note><q>A mishap</q>: “Malum.” This word probably signifies here the corporal punishment which was inflicted on the slaves. It has been already remarked that the actors were mostly slaves, and punishment ensued on their displeasing the Audience.</note> not less than any one of you. Born of a mortal mother, a mortal sire, it is not reasonable to be surprised if he has apprehensions for himself.</l> 
<l n="30">And I too, as well, who am the son of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, through my relationship to my father, stand in dread of ill. Therefore, in peace am I come to you, and peace do I bring. I wish a thing to be asked of you that’s reasonable and feasible; for, reasonable things to ask of the reasonable, a reasonable mediator have I been sent.</l> 
<l n="35">For from the reasonable it is not right to ask things unreasonable; whereas from the unreasonable to ask things reasonable, is sheer folly, since these unrighteous persons are ignorant of what is right, and observe it not. Now then, all lend your attention here to the things which I shall say. What we wish, you ought to wish as well:</l> 
   <l n="40">both I and my father have well deserved of you and of your state. But why should I mention how in Tragedies I have seen others, such as Neptune, Valour, Victory, Mars, Bellona, making mention of the good services which they had done you? Of all these benefits, the ruler of the Deities, my sire, was the founder.</l>
   <l n="46">But this has never been the habit of my father, to throw in your teeth what good he has done unto the good. He thinks that this is gratefully returned by you to him, and that he bestows these blessings on you deservedly, which he does bestow.</l> 
   <l n="50">Now, the matter which I came here to ask, I’ll first premise, after that I’ll tell the subject of this Tragedy. Why have you contracted your brows? Is it because I said that this would be a Tragedy? I am a God, and I’ll change it. This same, if you wish it, from a Tragedy I’ll make to be</l> 
   <l n="55">a Comedy, with all the lines the same. Whether would ye it were so, or not? But I’m too foolish; as though I didn’t know, who am a God, that you so wish it; upon this subject I understand what your feelings are. I’ll make this to be a mixture—a Tragi-comedy<note><q>A Tragi-comedy</q>: “Tragico-comœdia.” This is said to be the only occasion in which Tragi-comedy is mentioned by any of the ancient authors. Plautus does not, however, use the term in the sense which we apply to it. Gods being generally introduced into Tragedy alone, but here taking part in a Comedy he thinks it may be fairly called a Tragi-comedy, or a Comedy with the characters of Tragedy. This play is thought by some to have been borrowed from the writings of Epicharmus, the Sicilian dramatist.</note>.</l>
   <l n="60">For me to make it entirely to be a Comedy, where Kings and Gods appear, I do not deem right. What then? Since here the servant has a part as well, just as I said, I’ll make it to be a Tragi-comedy. Now <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> has ordered me to beg this of you,</l> 
   <l n="65">that the inspectors<note><q>The inspectors</q>: To the actor who was considered to give the most satisfaction to the Audience, it was customary for the Ædiles to present a reward, which they were bound to do without partiality. Officers, called “conquisitores,” were consequently employed to go about the “cavea,” or part of the theatre where the Audience sat, to see that there were no persons likely to have been hired for the purpose of applauding a particular actor.</note> should go among each of the seats throughout the whole theatre<note><q>Whole theatre</q>: “Cavea.” Literally, “the seats”  or “benches”  where the Audience sat</note>, amid the spectators, that, if they should see any suborned applauders of any actor, there should in the theatre be taken away from them the pledge of their coats, as a security for their good behaviour.</l>
   <l n="69">But if any should solicit the palm of victory for the actors, or if for any artist, whether by written letters, or whether any person himself should solicit personally, or whether by messenger; or if the Ædiles, too, should unfairly adjudge to any one the reward; <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> has commanded the law to be the same as if he had sought by solicitation an appointment for himself or for another.</l> 
   <l n="75">By valour has he declared that you exist as victors, not by canvassing or unfair dealing. Why any the less should there be the same principle for the player, which there is for the greatest man? By merit, not by favourers, ought we to seek our ends. He who does aright has ever favourers enough, 
    if there is honesty in them in whose disposal this matter<note><q>This matter</q>: The award of the prize.</note> rests. </l>
   <l n="81">This, too, he directed me likewise in his injunctions, that there should be inspectors over the players; that, he who should have procured suborned persons to applaud himself, or he who should have contrived for another give less satisfaction,</l> 
   <l n="85">from the same they might strip off his dress and leather<note><q>Leather</q>: “Corium.” It is a matter of doubt whether this word means the “persona,” or “leather mask”  worn by the actors, or the actor’s own hide or skin, which would suffer on his being flogged.</note> mask. I don’t wish you to be surprised, for what reason <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> now concerns himself about actors. Don’t be surprised, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> himself is about to take part in this play. Why are you wondering at this? As though, indeed, a new thing were now mentioned, that <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> takes to the calling of a player.</l> 
   <l n="91">But a year since<note><q>A year since</q>: It is conjectured that he is here dealing a hit at some Poet who had recently introduced <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> on the stage, perhaps in an awkward manner or at an untimely moment—not as taking part himself in the piece, but at the prayer of some one of the characters. Horace reprehends a similar practice in his time: “Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus;”  meaning, that a Deity may only be introduced when the circumstances are such as to warrant his interference.</note>, when here on the stage the actors invoked <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, he came; he aided them. Besides, surely in Tragedy he has a place. This play, I say, <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> himself will take a part in this day,</l> 
   <l n="95">and I together with him. Now do you give attention while I shall relate to you the subject of this Comedy. </l>
   <l n="97" rend="align(indent)">This city is <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>; in that house there <stage>pointing</stage>, Amphitryon<note><q>Amphitryon</q>: Perseus was the son of <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> and Danaë. By Andromeda, he was the father of Alcæus, Sthenelus, Nestor, and Electryon. Alcæus was the father of Amphitryon, while Electryon was the father of Alcmena, by Lysidice, the daughter of Pelops. Amphitryon, having accidentally slain Electryon, fled with his daughter Alcmena, who had been betrothed to him, to the court of Creon, King of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>. The brother of Alcmena having been slain by the Teleboans or Taphians, who inhabited certain islands on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002679">Acarnania</placeName>, Amphitryon undertook an expedition against them, at the head of the forces of Creon.</note> dwells, born at <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, of an <placeName key="tgn,5001993">Argive</placeName> sire; whose wife is Alcmena, daughter of Electryon.</l> 
   <l n="100">This Amphitrvon is now the general of the Theban troops; for between the Teleboans and the Theban people there is war. He, before he departed hence for the expedition, left his wife Alcmena pregnant. But I believe that you already know how my father is disposed how free in these affairs he has been,</l>
   <l n="105">and how great a lover of many a woman, if any object once has captivated him. Unknown to her husband, he began to love Alcmena, and took temporary possession of her person for himself, and made her pregnant, too, by his embrace.</l> 
   <l n="110">Now, that more fully you may understand the matter with respect to Alcmena, she is pregnant by both; both by her husband and by supreme <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName> And my father is now lying here <stage>he points to the house</stage> in-doors with her; and for this reason is this night made longer, while he is taking this pleasure with her whom he desires. </l>
   <l n="115">But he has so disguised himself, as though he were Amphitryon. Now, that you may not be surprised at this dress of mine, inasmuch as I have come out here this way in servile garb, an ancient and an antique circumstance, made new, will I relate to you, by reason of which I have come to you attired in this new fashion; </l>
   <l n="120">for lo! my father <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, now in the house, changes himself into the likeness of Amphitryon, and all the servants who see him think it is he, so shifting in his shape does he render himself when he chooses. I have taken on myself the form of the servant Sosia,</l>  <l n="125">who has gone hence together with Amphitryon on the expedition, that I may be able to serve my father in his amour, and that the servants may not be enquiring who I am, when they see me here frequenting oft the house. Now, as they will suppose me a servant and their fellow-servant, </l>
   <l n="130">not any one will enquire who I am, or why I’m come. My father, now in-doors, is gratifying his inclination, and is embracing her of whom he is especially enamoured. What has been done there at the army, my father is now relating to Alcmena. She, who really is with a paramour, thinks that he is her own husband. There, my father is now </l>

<l n="190">A city that has caused many a bitter death for the Theban people, that same has been conquered by the strength and valour of our soldiers, and taken by storm, under the command and conduct of my master Amphitryon in especial. With booty, territory, and glory<note><q>And glory</q>: “Adoreâ.” This was literally the allowance or largest of corn which was distributed to troops after a victory; hence it figuratively signifies “honor”  or “glory.”</note>,  too, has he loaded his fellow-citizens, and for Creon, King of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, has he firmly fixed his sway.</l>
<l n="195">From the harbour he has sent me before him to his house that I may bear these tidings to his wife, how he has promoted the public good by his guidance, conduct, and command. This now will I consider, in what manner I shall address her, when I’ve arrived there. If I tell a falsehood. I shall be doing as I am accustomed after my usual wont; for when they were fighting with all their might, then with all my might I ran away. </l>
<l n="200">But still I shall pretend as though I was present, and I’ll tell her what I heard. But in what manner and with what expressions it is right for me to tell my story, I still wish first to consider here with myself. 
<stage>He assumes an attitude of thought.</stage> In these terms will I give this narrative. “In the first place, when we arrived there, when first we made land, Amphitryon immediately made choice of the powerful men among the chieftains.</l>
<l n="205">Those he despatched on the embassy, and bade them tell his mind to the Teleboans; that if without constraint and without warfare they should be ready to deliver up what was plundered and the plunderers, and if they should be ready to restore what they had carried off, he would immediately conduct the army homewards, that the Greeks would depart from their territory, and that he would grant peace and quietness to them: but if they should be otherwise disposed, and not concede the things which he demanded,</l> 
   <l n="210">he, in consequence, would attack their city with extreme violence and with his men. When the embassadors had repeated these things, which Amphitryon had enjoined, in order to the Teleboans, being men stout of heart, relying on their valour, and confident in their prowess, they rebuked our embassadors very rudely. They answered that they were able in warfare to protect themselves and theirs, and that at once they must lead the army with all haste out of their territories.</l> 
   <l n="216">When the embassadors brought back this message, straightway Amphitryon drew out all his army from the encampment; on the other side, the Teleboans led forth their legions from the town, furnished with most gorgeous arms. After they had gone forth on either side in full array,</l> 
   <l n="220">the soldiers were marshalled, the ranks were formed. We, after our manner and usage, drew up our legions; the enemy, too, drew up their legions facing us. Then either general went forth into the mid-space beyond the throng of the ranks, and they parleyed together.</l> 
   <l n="225">It was agreed between them, that, which ever side should be conquered in that battle, they should surrender up their city, lands, altars, hearths. and theraselves. After that was done, the trumpets on either side gave the signal; the earth re-echoed, they raised a shout on either side. Each general, both upon this side and on that, offered vows to <placeName key="tgn,1125260">Jupiter</placeName>, and then encouraged his troops.</l> 
   <l n="231">Each man according to his ability does that which each one can and has the strength to do; he smites with his falchion; the weapons crash; the welkin bellows with the uproar of the men; of breaths and pantings a cloud is formed; men fall by wounds inflicted by men.</l> 
   <l n="235">At length, as we desired, our troops conquered; the foe fell in numbers; ours, on the other hand, pressed on; firm in our strength, we were victorious. But still not one betook himself to flight, nor yet gave way at his post, but standing there<note><q>Standing there</q>: This seems to be the true meaning of “statim”  in this passage.</note> he waged the combat.</l> 
   <l n="240">Sooner than quit the spot, they parted with their lives; each, as he stood, lay there and kept his rank in death. When my master Amphitryon saw this, at once he ordered the cavalry on the right to charge. The cavalry obeyed directly; from the right wing, </l>
   <l n="245">with a tremendous shout, with brisk onset they rushed on; and rightfully did they slaughter and trample down the impious forces of the foe.”</l> </sp>

   <l n="248" rend="align(indent)">Not even one word of these has he yet uttered correctly; for I was there in the battle personally, and my father too, when it was fought.</l> </sp>

<stage>continuing.</stage>
   <l n="250" rend="align(indent)">"The enemy betook themselves to flight. Then was new spirit added to our men, the Teleboans flying, with darts were their bodies filled, and Amphitryon himself, with his own hand, struck off the head of Pterelas their king. This battle was being fought there even from the morning till the evening. This do I the better remember for this reason; because on that day I went without my breakfast.</l>
   <l n="255">But night at last, by its interposing, cut short this combat. The next day, the chiefs came weeping from the city to us at the camp. With covered hands<note><q>With covered hands</q>: He alludes here to the carrying of the “velamenta,” which were branches of olive, surrounded with bandages of wool, and held in the hands of those who sued for mercy or pardon. The wool covered the hand, and was emblematical of peace, the hand being thereby rendered powerless to effect mischief.</note>, they entreated us to pardon their offences; and they all surrendered rendered up themselves. and all things divine and human, their city and their children, into the possession and unto the disposal of the Theban people.</l> 
   <l n="260">Lastly, by reason of his valour, a golden goblet was presented to my master Amphitryon, from which king Pterelas<note><q>King Pterelas</q>: Pterela, or Pterelas, was the son of Hippothoë, the cousin of Amphitryon and Alcmena. He had a daughter named Cymetho, or Cometho, and his fate was said to depend upon the preservation of a certain lock of his hair. Cymetho, smitten with love for Amphitryon, or, according to some accounts, for Cephalus, his associate in the enterprise, cut off the fatal lock, and, like Scylla, betrayed her father, who was afterwards slain by Amphitryon.</note> had been used to drink.” These things I’ll thus tell my mistress.

Pliny mentions the obsidian stone, or, as it is now called, Icelandic agate, as being used for this purpose. He also says that mirrors were made in the glass-houses of Sidon, which consisted of glass plates with leaves of metal at the back. These were probably of an inferior character. Those of copper and tin were made chiefly at Brundisium. The white metal formed from this mixture soon becoming dim, a sponge, with powdered pumice-stone, was usually fastened to the mirrors made of that composition. They were generally small, of round or oval shape, and having a handle. The female slaves usually held them while their mistresses were performing the duties of the toilet.

Heinsius and Vossius, however, were of this extraordinary opinion. They probably did not reflect that Plautus, for the sake of finding material for his Play, supposed the same intercourse to have been repeated on the same night on which Hercules was born.</note>; of these the one is the son of Amphitryon<note><q>Son of Amphitryon</q>: Iphiclus was the son of Amphitryon.</note>, the other of Jupiter.

 <l n="490">and that the clandestine connexion may remain concealed. Although, as I have said just now, Amphitryon shall still know all the matter in the end. What then? No one surely will impute it to Alcmena as a disgrace; for it does not seem that a God is acting justly</l>
<l n="495">to permit his own offences and his own faultiness to fall upon a mortal. I’ll cut short my talk: the door makes a noise. See, the counterfeit Amphitryon is coming out of doors, and together with him Alcmena, the wife that he has taken the loan of.</l>  </sp> </div>

<l n="645">he betakes himself home. I shall bear and ever endure his absence with mind resolved and steadfast; if only this reward is granted me, that my husband shall be hailed the conqueror in the warfare, sufficient for myself will I deem it.

In a Note, he wonders “why an apple (or any fruit) should be given to a pregnant woman.” Sosia seems to explain the reason, in saying that if she feels faint, she will have something to gnaw. It is not improbable that tension of the muscles may in some degree counteract a tendency to faint.

In the Mercator, Acanthio runs to his master Charinus, to tell him that his mistress Pasicompsa has been seen in the ship by his father Demipho; in the Stichus, Dinacium (Pinacium), a slave, informs his mistress Panegyris (Philumena) that her husband has put into port on his return from Asia; and in the Mostellaria, Tranio brings information of the unexpected coming of Theuropides, an old gentleman. Terence has censured the like practice, in the Prologue to the Self-Tormentor.”</note>? He is bringing news that the ship is safe, or else the approach of some angry old blade; whereas I am obeying the bidding of Jove, and by his command do I now hie me. </l>
 <l n="990">For this reason, it is more fitting to get out of the road and to make room for me. My father calls me, I am following him, to his orders so given am I obedient. As it befits a son to be dutiful to his father, just so am I to my father; in his amours I play second fiddle to him, I encourage him, assist him, advise him, rejoice with him. If anything is pleasing to my father, that pleasure is an extremely great one for myself. </l>
 <l n="995">Is he amorously disposed? He is wise; he does right, inasmuch as he follows his inclination; a thing that all men ought to do, so long as it is done in a proper manner. Now, my father wishes Amphitryon to be cajoled; I’ll take care, Spectators, that he shall be rarely cajoled, while you look on. I’ll place a chaplet on my head, and pretend that I am drunk. </l>
 <l n="1000">And up there <stage>pointing to the top of the house</stage> will I get; from that spot, at the top of the house, I’ll cleverly drive this person off when he comes hither: I’ll take care that, sober, he shall be drenched.

It’s proper for me to be obedient to my father; it’s right to be subservient to his pleasure. </l>
 <l n="1005">But see! here is Amphitryon; he’s coming. Now shall he be rarely fooled, if, indeed, <stage>to the AUDIENCE</stage> you are willing, by listening, to lend your attention. I’ll go in-doors, and assume a garb<note><q>Assume a garb</q>: He perhaps means not only the chaplet worn by the reveller on his head, but the garb of a slave also.</note> that more becomes me; then I’ll go up upon the roof, that I may drive him off from hence.</l> <stage>Goes into the house, and fastens the door.</stage>  </sp> </div></div>

<l n="1065">propitious both to thee and thine, the Ruler of the Heavens comes. Arise,” it said, “ye who have fallen down in your terror through dread of me.” As I lay, I arose; I fancied that the house was in flames.
